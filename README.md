Content is the most important aspect of any online business, and every content creator or entrepreneur needs content to make money.

The more high-quality content you will publish, the more eyes of your potential customers you are going to attract. Not only you can use the content for marketing purposes, but you can also sell it in the format of ebooks, courses, etc.

But the problem with content, especially written one, is that it takes a long time to create it, and it is one of the most unenjoyable tasks for many business owners.

Thankfully, there are some shortcuts today that we can take, and that is PLR content.

In case you don’t know, PLR is a licensing type that stands for Prive Label Rights. These rights allow you to legally use someone else’s created content as your own without any attribution required.

Whether you want to create articles, videos, or audio, PLR products can save you tremendous amounts of time.

In this blog post, we are going to cover how to effectively use done-for-you PLR content to make money online in 2023.

So here we go:

### Rebrand PLR content:

Before using PLR content in any way it is highly recommended that you rebrand it. By rebranding, we mean adding your personal touch to it and changing content into unique. 

You can also rebrand PLR products by rewriting certain bits of text, adding your logo, changing the titles, or redesigning the product’s cover.

By doing so, you will ensure that you are providing original value to the market, as well as protect yourself from plagiarism-related issues.

This specifically applies, if you want to publish PLR content as the articles on your blog to rank them on Google. Google is pretty strict with plagiarism and it only ranks unique content that brings unique value.

So if you are planning to get organic visitors to the PLR articles, rebranding is a must. Other than that, you can use PLR products as they are, but providing something unique to the audience is always a beneficial move.

### Use PLR For Marketing Purposes:

We have just covered how PLR articles could be used on website blogs once they are turned into unique, but there are more ways to use PLR content in marketing.

You can also publish PLR articles on your social media profiles, as well as use them as newsletters in the email marketing process.

PLR license also allows you to repurpose written PLR content into other formats. So why not turn PLR articles into videos that you could publish on YouTube? Besides that, people tend to repurpose PLR articles into audio and use them as podcasts.

The most popular way to use PLR content in the marketing process is to use it as lead magnets.

A lead magnet is a free gift that you can give to your potential subscribers so they could become a member of your email list.

PLR products like ebooks, software, cheatsheets, and action guides work perfectly as incentives for the user to leave his email address to you, and the great thing about them is that they are already created for you. 

### Resell It Online:

Digital products are in huge demand right now, and you can make tons of money while selling them.

Instead of creating products from scratch that we could sell, we can use done-for-you PLR products.

Products like PLR ebooks, courses, planners, software, and others are selling now like never before, and you can sell them either from your own website, or various digital product marketplaces.

As we like to say - you only need to create a digital product once in order to sell it million times, but in this case, you don’t even have to create anything.

### Other Ways To Sse PLR Content:

It’s down to your imagination how you’d like to use PLR products as there are endless ways to make money with them. 

To give you more ideas, here are more ways how you could use PLR content efficiently:

Packaging with other digital products to increase value
Adding to free or paid membership sites
Giving away for free to the current subscribers to strengthen the relationships
Using PLR content as the coaching resources
Create new digital products from various PLR contents
Use PLR content for link building, such as guest posts, WEB 2.0s, etc.
